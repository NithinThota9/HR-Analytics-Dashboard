# 👥 Employee Attrition Analysis Dashboard (Tableau)

Overview

This project is an interactive HR Attrition Analytics Dashboard built using Tableau to help organizations understand workforce turnover patterns and identify high-risk employee groups.

The dashboard analyzes employee demographics, department distribution, satisfaction levels, and education background to uncover the underlying reasons behind employee attrition.

Instead of static HR reports, this dashboard enables leadership to visually explore retention risk and make proactive workforce decisions.

Business Problem

Employee turnover is expensive and disruptive.
HR teams often know how many employees leave — but not why they leave.

This dashboard answers questions such as:

Which employees are most likely to leave?

Are certain departments facing retention issues?

Does age or experience impact attrition?

Is job satisfaction linked to turnover?

Does education background influence retention?
